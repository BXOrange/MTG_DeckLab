# CLAUDE.md — project wiki for Claude

Orientation for working in this repo. Keep it current when you change
architecture, conventions, or the rules-engine feature set.

## What this is

An MTG (Magic: The Gathering) deck analyzer with a **rules-accurate game
engine**. The headline feature is the **"Goldfisch" (goldfish) mode**: play a
saved deck against the real backend rules engine — step through the turn, play
lands, tap mana, cast spells with the stack, attack, all validated server-side
against the Comprehensive Rules (referenced as `RULE <n>` throughout the code).

Two halves:
- **`backend/`** — Python (FastAPI). The card model, rules engine, oracle
  effect IR, and the game-session API. This is where the depth is.
- **`frontend/`** — a static, buildless ES-modules app (no bundler). Tabs for
  deck import/analysis, saved decks, the goldfish board, the card cache, and an
  **"Engine-Status"** tab documenting engine coverage. UI language is **German**;
  MTG keyword names stay English ("Flying", "Trample").

## Run & test

```bash
# Full app (frontend static server on http://localhost:8765; sets up backend venv)
./start.sh                     # add --backend-tests to also run pytest

# Backend tests directly (do this after any backend change)
cd backend && python -m pytest -q
# or: source backend/venv/bin/activate && pytest backend/tests/
```

The backend FastAPI app is `mtg_analyzer.api.app:app`. There is **no JS build
step** and no Node toolchain — edit `frontend/src/**` and reload. There is no
JS test runner, so validate frontend changes by reasoning + reading; validate
backend changes with pytest (the suite is fast, ~500+ tests, keep it green).

## Architecture & data flow

```
Card (models/card.py)            immutable printed characteristics
  └─ GameObject (models/game_object.py)   one instance in a zone, mutable state
GameState (models/game_state.py)  battlefield/stack/players/turn + event bus
RulesEngine (game/rules_engine.py) rules primitives: cast, damage, draw, SBAs…
GameEngine  (game/game_engine.py)  turn/phase loop, actions, legal_actions, combat
GameSession (services/game_session.py) wraps an engine: snapshots/undo, wire view
API (api/game.py)  ── JSON ──▶  frontend (src/js/goldfishView.js)
```

Oracle-text → behaviour pipeline (docs/09):
`AbilitySpec` IR (`parser/oracle/spec.py`, pure JSON-shaped data, the security
boundary) → **binder** (`game/effect_binder.py`) → live `GameEffect` objects via
the `EffectRegistry` (`game/effects.py`). **Bind-on-load** is wired:
`build_goldfish_engine` calls `bind_from_catalogue(obj)` for every object it
creates, sourcing specs from `game/ability_catalogue.py` (a hand-authored,
name-keyed registry — e.g. Evolving Wilds' fetch). The NLP front-end that would
produce specs from *arbitrary* oracle text is not built yet; the catalogue is
the seam it plugs into (`specs_for` falls back to it later).

### Key game/ modules
- `effects.py` — effect hierarchy + `EffectRegistry` (whitelisted `type` →
  factory). One-shot effects, `TriggeredAbility`, `ActivatedAbility`,
  `StaticEffect` (phase-skip), `StaticAbility` (layer system), `ReplacementEffect`.
- `combat.py` — combat/evasion **keyword recognition** (off Scryfall `keywords`
  + oracle text) and the rules they impose (blocking legality, damage steps).
- `continuous.py` — the **RULE 613 layer engine**. `recompute(state)` re-derives
  every battlefield permanent's characteristics in layer order and stamps
  derived P/T, types, granted keywords + a per-object `static_trace`.
- `costs.py` — regex parser for **activated-ability costs** (`Cost: Effect`).
- `ability_catalogue.py` — card→`AbilitySpec` registry (bind-on-load source) +
  `enters_tapped` (RULE 614.1, oracle-derived).
- `targeting.py` — legal-target computation (RULE 115 / 601.2c).
- `mana_abilities.py`, `models/mana_cost.py`, `models/mana_pool.py` — mana.

## Implementation state (summary)

The user-facing detail lives in the frontend **Engine-Status tab**
(`frontend/src/js/implementationStatusView.js`) — keep that file in sync when
the engine gains/loses coverage. In short, **implemented**: full turn/stack/SBA
loop; London mulligan; targeting; mana (generic/color/colorless/hybrid/mono-
hybrid/phyrexian/{X}); all common **combat keywords** (flying, reach, first/
double strike, deathtouch, trample, vigilance, lifelink, menace, defender,
haste, indestructible, protection-from); **static abilities** via the layer
system (layers 4/6/7 + cost adjustment); **activated abilities** with full cost
parsing; **triggered abilities** (event-based) + replacement effects; one-shot
effects (damage/draw/destroy/counter/search/gain_life/cascade/discover/…);
commander damage; counters. **Not yet**: oracle NLP parser, interactive
blocker/multiplayer priority, `replacement`/`keyword` ability-kind binding,
layers 1–3/5/7a/7e, ordering choices (RULE 616.1/603.3b), commander tax.

Living backlogs: `backend/ToDo_Backend.md` (open) and `backend/Done_Backend.md`
(shipped). Design docs: `docs/01`–`09` + `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **RULE references**: comment rules-relevant code with the CR number
  (`RULE 613.7`). Match the surrounding comment density and style. To read the
  actual rule text, use the wiki in `Reference/rules_wiki/` — it maps every rule
  number and glossary term to its line in the CR source (too large to load whole);
  regenerate with `build_wiki.py` after a rules update.
- **Model → game import boundary**: `models/` must not import `game/` at module
  load. Where a model needs engine logic (e.g. `GameObject.to_dict` showing
  keywords), use a **function-scoped import** and keep the `game/` side pure of
  runtime model imports (`combat.py`, `continuous.py` only import models under
  `TYPE_CHECKING`).
- **Derived characteristics**: `GameObject.power/toughness/is_creature/
  granted_keywords` read layer-engine output stamped by `continuous.recompute`,
  falling back to printed+counters when no pass has run. Recompute runs on every
  SBA pass and before the session view — call `engine.recompute_continuous_effects()`
  if you read derived state outside those points.
- **Security**: nothing derived from card text becomes code. Effects are a
  whitelisted `type` string + clamped params (`spec.py`); the binder is the only
  thing that turns specs into behaviour.
- **Frontend**: no framework. Views are `render*(container)` functions setting
  `innerHTML` and wiring listeners; escape user/card text with `escapeHtml` /
  `escapeAttr`. Client-only prefs persist via cookies (`cookies.js`).
- **Commits**: only when asked; branch first if on `main`. End commit messages
  with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
