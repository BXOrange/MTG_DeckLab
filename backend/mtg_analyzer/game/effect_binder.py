"""Bind `AbilitySpec` data into live `GameEffect` objects (docs/09 back-end).

Reference: docs/concepts/09_ORACLE_EFFECT_PARSER.md ("RUNTIME LINKING: parse-on-load,
bind-per-game" and the two-stage compiler).

This is the parser *back-end*: it takes the pure `AbilitySpec` IR the
front-end produced and turns it into the engine's `GameEffect` objects,
using only the whitelisted `EffectRegistry`. It is the one place allowed to
bridge `parser.oracle` (pure data) and `game.effects` (behaviour).

Binding is **per game instance** (each `GameEffect` carries its own
`source`), so it runs when a `GameObject` is created — never persisted.
Unknown effect types are refused here (`BindError`) rather than executing
anything derived from card text: the security boundary from docs/09.
