"""Card → `AbilitySpec` catalogue: the bind-on-load source of card behaviour.

The engine turns a card's abilities into behaviour by binding `AbilitySpec`s
(the IR, `parser/oracle/spec.py`) onto its `GameObject`. Until the oracle-text
NLP parser (docs/09) exists, those specs come from the **hand-authored,
name-keyed registry here**. `specs_for(card)` is the single entry point the
binder (`effect_binder.bind_from_catalogue`) consults when a game is built.

This is deliberately the seam the future parser plugs into: when it lands,
`specs_for` can fall back to it for any card not in the registry, and nothing
else in the engine has to change. Register a card with `register(name, factory)`
where ``factory`` returns fresh specs each call (specs are mutated when bound —
their effects get a source — so each object must get its own copies).

`enters_tapped(card)` is a separate, *oracle-derived* rule (RULE 614.1): it
reads the printed text, so every plain tap-land works without being registered.
