"""Targeting: what an effect may target and which targets are legal *now*.

Reference: RULE 115 (targets), RULE 601.2c (a spell can't be cast unless the
required number of legal targets is available), RULE 608.2b (on resolution a
spell/ability with no legal targets doesn't resolve).

An effect either **targets** ("deal 3 damage to *target* creature") or acts
**globally / on a fixed set** ("each player draws", "destroy all creatures",
"you gain 3 life"). This module is the one place that (a) names *what kind*
of target a targeting effect wants (`TargetSpec`) and (b) computes the
*currently legal* targets from a `GameState` (`legal_targets`). The engine
uses it to gate an action: if a spell needs a target and the board offers
none, the action is offered **locked** rather than castable — the offer-time
half of RULE 601.2c.

Kept dependency-light: it reads models and duck-types an effect's
``target_spec`` attribute, so `game/effects.py` can import `TargetSpec` from
here without a cycle.
