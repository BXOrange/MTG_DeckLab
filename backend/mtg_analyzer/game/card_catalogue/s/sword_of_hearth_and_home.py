    — Sword of Hearth and Home. Simplified: only the ramp half ("search
    your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield") is
    modeled — the "exile up to one target creature you own, then reunite it
    with the land" blink half needs a two-part simultaneous re-entry this
    engine's `search` effect can't express, so it's dropped rather than
    guessed at.
