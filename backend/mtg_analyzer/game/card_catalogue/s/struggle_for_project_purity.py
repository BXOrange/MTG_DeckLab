    """As this enchantment enters, choose Brotherhood or Enclave.
    • Brotherhood — At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent draws a
    card. You draw a card for each card drawn this way.
    • Enclave — Whenever a player attacks you with one or more creatures,
    that player gets twice that many rad counters.

    — Struggle for Project Purity. A "choose a named mode as this enters,
    persisting for the rest of the game" shape (RULE 601.2b-adjacent, but
    choosing between two flavour-named ability sets rather than a creature
    type/colour) — a new third `enter_choice_effects` sibling
    (`ChooseNamedModeReplacement`, alongside `ChooseCreatureTypeReplacement`/
    `ChooseColorReplacement`), stamping `GameObject.chosen_mode`. Brotherhood
    is an ordinary `TriggeredAbility`, just gated by `effect_binder._trigger_
    condition`'s new ``"named_mode"`` predicate so it only fires once
    "brotherhood" was actually chosen; its "you draw a card for each card
    drawn this way" is `DrawCardEffect`'s new ``"opponents_you_have"``
    count_selector. Enclave needs a genuinely new aggregate event
    (`EventType.PLAYER_ATTACKED`, fired once per combat rather than once per
    attacking creature — see its own docstring) plus the same per-firing
    marker mechanism the other rad-counter cards use
    (`rad_counters_on_attacked`, gated the same way via its own
    ``requires_mode`` key, since it's resolved by a dedicated collector
    rather than the ordinary `TriggeredAbility` condition machinery).
