    """Shatterskull Smashing deals X damage divided as you choose among up to
    two target creatures and/or planeswalkers. If X is 6 or more, it deals
    twice X divided among them instead.

    — Shatterskull Smashing (the sorcery *front* face of the MDFC; its back is
    the land Shatterskull, the Hammer Pass, so the spell casts as an ordinary
    {X}{R}{R} sorcery — no modal-DFC machinery needed for this face). First
    consumer of the `divided` damage primitive: the announced {X} pool is
    split across the chosen targets (``divided`` + ``count`` 2 ``optional``),
    doubling at ``double_at=6`` (RULE 107.3). **Documented simplifications**:
    the "and/or planeswalkers" half of the target set is dropped (``creature``
    only — planeswalker damage targeting), and the "as you choose" split
    defaults to an even distribution (`DealDamageEffect._apply_divided`) — the
    total dealt and which creatures take it are exact; only the freedom to
    lump it unevenly is auto-made.
