    many rad counters.
    Whenever an opponent mills a nonland card, if this creature is in your
    graveyard, you may return it to your hand.

    — Infesting Radroach. "That many" ties the rad-counter amount to the
    combat damage just dealt (`rad_counters_on_combat_damage`'s
    ``"damage_amount"`` sentinel, `RulesEngine._collect_rad_counter_damage_
    triggers`). The graveyard-return-on-opponent-mill ability is RULE

    while its source sits in the graveyard, not a bind-once
    `TriggeredAbility` at all — see `AbilitySpec.mill_return_from_graveyard`/
    `RulesEngine._collect_mill_return_from_graveyard_triggers`.
