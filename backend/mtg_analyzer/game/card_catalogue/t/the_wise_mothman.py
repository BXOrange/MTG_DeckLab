def _the_wise_mothman() -> list[AbilitySpec]:
    """Flying
    Whenever The Wise Mothman enters or attacks, each player gets a rad
    counter.
    Whenever one or more nonland cards are milled, put a +1/+1 counter on
    each of up to X target creatures, where X is the number of nonland
    cards milled this way.

    — The Wise Mothman. The first ability is otherwise fully covered by the
    oracle-text parser's own "~ enters or attacks" grammar and its
    ``add_player_counters``/``each_player`` selector (confirmed by direct
    `parse_oracle` output — see `docs/implementation-state/Done_Backend.md`
    "Library-top ... closeout" batch), but registering this card at all
    (needed for the second ability, below) makes `specs_for` skip the
    parser entirely for it (registry wins wholesale), so it's reproduced
    here verbatim rather than left to fall through.

    The second ability is *simplified*: rather than a genuinely dynamic
    "up to X target creatures where X is milled this way" (X varying per
    firing the way Rampage's block-count bonus does — this catalogue's
    sanctioned answer for that shape is building a fresh `TriggeredAbility`
    directly at the firing call site, `RulesEngine.check_rampage`), this
    reuses the same per-nonland-card `EventType.MILL_CARD` Glowing One/
    Infesting Radroach's mill triggers use: "put a +1/+1 counter on up to
    one target creature" fires once *per* nonland card milled (any player's
    mill, unscoped ``"group"`` subject, same as Glowing One). Across N
    simultaneous nonland mills this reaches the identical set of possible
    end states as the real card's single "up to X targets" choice — for
    each of N independent chances you may put a counter on some creature or
    decline — just as N separate optional triggers instead of one modal
    "choose up to X targets" ability; only trigger *count* (irrelevant to
    every card in this engine's corpus today) differs. The same "for each,
    optionally act" broadcast simplification `_dismantling_wave`-shaped
    entries elsewhere in this catalogue already use for a fixed-count
    "for each opponent" case, just driven by a per-firing count instead.
