    — Fire Covenant. Combines the `divided` damage primitive with the same
    ``additional_cost={"pay_life": "x"}`` X-from-life shape as Toxic Deluge
    (RULE 601.2b — X is defined by the announced life payment, not a mana
    {X}, and threaded into the ``"x"`` amount by `RulesEngine._substitute_x`).
    "Any number of target creatures" is capped at ``count`` 10 for target
    offering (a UI cap — a real board never has X-1's worth of relevant
    creatures beyond that); the even-split "as you choose" simplification is
    the same as Shatterskull's.
