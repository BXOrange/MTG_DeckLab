    — Nuka-Nuke Launcher. The +3/+0-and-intimidate anthem grant and Equip
    cost both parse generically (an ordinary attached-permanent static +
    the standard Equip keyword ability). Only the triggered ability
    needs hand-authoring: a *recurring*, bounded-duration player-scoped
    trigger (`InstallTemporaryPlayerTriggerEffect`/`GameState.temporary_
    player_triggers`) — no oracle-text grammar exists for "until the end
    of X's next turn, <recurring effect>" (a genuinely different shape
    from RULE 603.7's existing one-shot `CreateDelayedTriggerEffect`).
    The "whenever equipped creature attacks" trigger subject itself does
    parse generically now (`_ATTACHED_SUBJECT_RE`), so this AbilitySpec's
    ``trigger`` is written the same way the parser would emit it.
