    (RULE 702.96, already recognized as a keyword so it doesn't block this

    exiles one target rather than rewriting "target" to "each" (see
    docs/implementation-state/BACKLOG.md). ``target_kind="creature"``
    drops the "you don't control" restriction — a documented simplification,
    no target kind carries an ownership exclusion yet.
