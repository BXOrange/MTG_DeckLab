# "Wyleth Equip" — Boros equipment/voltron commander deck. Every entry below
# hand-authors the *whole* card (not just its unclaimed clause): registering
# a name skips the oracle-text parser fallback entirely (`specs_for`'s
# precedence order), so any already-parser-claimable clause (e.g. a plain
# attached-permanent anthem) has to be repeated here too, not just the part
# the parser couldn't reach. Several clauses are deliberately simplified or
# dropped — each says so inline — where the engine has no primitive for the
# real shape yet (X-spells scaling an effect, phasing, per-object dynamic
# "that creature" references, a genuine two-independent-target activated
# ability); see `docs/implementation-state/BACKLOG.md` for the running list.
