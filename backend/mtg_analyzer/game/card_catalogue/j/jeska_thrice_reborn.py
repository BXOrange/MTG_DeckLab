    """Jeska enters with a loyalty counter on her for each time you've cast a
    commander from the command zone this game.
    0: Choose target creature. Until your next turn, if that creature would
    deal combat damage to one of your opponents, it deals triple that damage
    to that player instead.
    −X: Jeska deals X damage to each of up to three targets.

    — Jeska, Thrice Reborn. Two of the three lines ride shipped primitives:
    the entry counters read `Player.commander_casts` (already tracked for
    RULE 903.8's commander tax — no new state), and the −X is the shipped
    divided-damage shape with ``count=3``/``optional=True``.

    The 0 is the interesting one: it's a **targeted, duration-bounded damage
    multiplier**, which the shipped RULE 616.1 ``double_damage`` replacement
    family (Furnace of Rath/Fiery Emancipation — standing, board-wide,
    permanent-sourced) could *almost* express. Rather than a new mechanism
    it reuses that family's `multiplier` param with two new scopes the
    family already wanted: a specific source instance, and "combat damage to
    an opponent of the effect's controller" — installed as a turn-scoped
    `ReplacementEffect` on the targeted creature, the same
    `RegenerateEffect`-shaped per-object shield the engine already uses.
