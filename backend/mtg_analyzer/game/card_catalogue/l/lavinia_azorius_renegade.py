# cEDH staples cube — batch 25, wave 1: state-tracking primitives
#
# Six cards whose only real blocker was that the engine kept no *record* of
# something that had already happened: how much mana a spell was paid with,
# who a creature connected with in combat, what was sacrificed to an
# additional cost, how many symbols of a colour are on the board. Each is now
# a first-class piece of state (`GameObject.mana_spent_to_cast`/
# `sacrificed_cost_mana_value`, `GameState.combat_damage_to_players_this_turn`,
# `continuous.count_selector`'s devotion/legendary/named-card entries) rather
# than something re-derived — none of it *can* be re-derived after the fact.

    """Each opponent can't cast noncreature spells with mana value greater
    than the number of lands that player controls.
    Whenever an opponent casts a spell, if no mana was spent to cast it,
    counter that spell.

    — Lavinia, Azorius Renegade. Both halves needed a new primitive:

    * the prohibition is the first ``cast_prohibition`` static (RULE 601.3a)
      — a *conditional* veto on one specific spell, unlike the pre-existing
      ``cast_limit``'s flat per-turn count. Its ``max_mana_value_selector``
      is evaluated for the **casting** player ("*that player*'s lands"), not
      the static's own controller, which is why it can't be a plain layer-
      engine value (`continuous.cast_prohibited`).
    * the counter-trigger reads the `SPELL_CAST` event's new ``mana_spent``
      key (RULE 202.1/601.2h). Deliberately *not* the pre-existing ``free``
      flag: a spell cast for an alternative cost of {0}, or one whose cost
      was reduced to {0}, spends no mana while still being a paid cast —
      Lavinia catches those too, which is most of why she is played.
      "Counter that spell" is the already-built RULE 603.3d ``reflexive``
      trigger shape (`TriggeredAbility.reflexive`), whose docstring named
      this card as its motivating example before it had one.
