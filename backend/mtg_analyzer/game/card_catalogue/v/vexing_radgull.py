    fold-in). The branch is the same per-firing marker mechanism Glowing
    One/Infesting Radroach use (`rad_counters_on_combat_damage`, the
    damaged player varies per firing — no oracle-text grammar for that at
    all), extended with its own ``else`` key
    (`RulesEngine._collect_rad_counter_damage_triggers`): the damaged
    player gets 2 rad counters if they currently have none, otherwise a
    real RULE 701.30 proliferate happens instead (`game/effects/core.py`'s
    `ProliferateEffect`, which now also proliferates player-level counters
    — a documented gap this card is the first to actually need closed).
