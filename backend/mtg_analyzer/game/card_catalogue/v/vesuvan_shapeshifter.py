    """You may have this creature enter the battlefield as a copy of any
    creature on the battlefield, except it's a Shapeshifter in addition to
    its other types.
    As long as ~ is untapped, you may have it be a copy of another target
    creature, except it's a Shapeshifter in addition to its other types.

    — Vesuvan Shapeshifter: the driving real-card example for the layer-1
    *conditional/continuous* copy mechanism (`game/continuous.py`'s
    `_apply_copy_layer`), unlike the three ETB-only cards above (Clever
    Impersonator/Phantasmal Image/Copy Artifact), which copy once and never
    revert. Three specs: the same RULE 614.1c/614.12 `enter_as_copy`
    replacement those use for its own ETB half; a `static` `conditional_copy`
    spec driving the continuous layer-1 pass (reverts the instant it's
    tapped, per the real card's "as long as untapped" wording); and an
    `activated` spec exposing "choose a new target" — RULE 707.9's "special
    action" isn't modeled as its own timing category, so this is simplified
    to a costless, sorcery-speed-only activated ability instead (same
    simplification tier as other documented ones in this file). Per the real
    Vesuvan Shapeshifter ruling, copying a creature with no similar ability
    *locks in* — the copied creature's own abilities replace this one's
    `conditional_copy`/`set_copy_target` entirely (RULE 707.2), so there's
    nothing left to revert or re-target with until something else grants an
    equivalent ability.
