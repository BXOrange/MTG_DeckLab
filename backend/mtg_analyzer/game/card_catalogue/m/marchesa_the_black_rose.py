    """Dethrone (Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most
    life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on it.)
    Other creatures you control have dethrone.
    Whenever a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies,
    return that card to the battlefield under your control at the
    beginning of the next end step.

    — Marchesa, the Black Rose. Her own printed Dethrone needs no
    hand-authoring — it's a plain Scryfall keyword flag `combat.has` already
    recognizes (`RulesEngine.check_dethrone`, called from `GameEngine.
    declare_attackers` since Dethrone's amount is fixed per-firing rather
    than bind-on-load, the same "per-firing dynamic" reason `check_rampage`
    isn't a bind-time `TriggeredAbility` either). The "Other creatures you
    control have dethrone" static *is* hand-authored here, below, as an
    ordinary layer-6 `grant_keyword` — `check_dethrone` reads `combat.has`
    fresh at attack-declaration time, so a creature holding the granted
    keyword dethrones exactly like one with it printed. The third clause
    (the RULE 603.7 delayed-return trigger) is modeled via
    `AbilitySpec.counter_death_return`/`RulesEngine._collect_counter_
    death_return_triggers` — a good showcase card for the "planned"
    delayed-trigger UI panel, same reason Ephemerate/Sneak Attack/Meek
    Attack were picked.
