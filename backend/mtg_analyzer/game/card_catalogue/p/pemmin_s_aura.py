    """Enchant creature
    {U}: Untap enchanted creature.
    {U}: Enchanted creature gains flying until end of turn.
    {U}: Enchanted creature gains shroud until end of turn.
    {1}: Enchanted creature gets +1/-1 or -1/+1 until end of turn.

    — Pemmin's Aura. The first three lines already parse; the fourth was the
    "inline two-way modal with no bulleted header" the blocker list named —
    "A or B" in a single sentence, which the RULE 700.2 modal grammar (built
    for the bulleted block) doesn't recognize.

    Modeled as **two separate activated abilities**, one per half, rather
    than one ability with a RULE 700.2 mode choice: `modes` is only
    supported on spell/triggered abilities (an *activated* ability has no
    mode-choice window in this engine), and splitting is a faithful model
    anyway — the player's choice of which ability to activate *is* the
    printed choice, made at the same moment, with the same result. That
    keeps the card fully playable without inventing an activation-time mode
    prompt no other card needs.

    The oracle-text front-end now recognizes that shape itself
    (`segmenter._inline_pt_modal_bodies`, which rebuilds "gets A or B" as
    two complete clauses and emits one activated ability each), so this
    entry is no longer load-bearing — it's left registered rather than
    deleted, the same "no harm in both existing side by side" call the
    `top_library_permission` entries document, since the hand-authored
    registry always wins for a registered card and the two agree.
