    — Dauntless Dismantler. The static half was *already* covered by the
    shipped board-wide ``enters_tapped`` static (`continuous.
    enters_tapped_from_static`) — only the activated ability left the card
    unmodeled.

    That ability needed a mass destroy whose **filter** is the ability's own
    announced X rather than a printed constant: the shipped
    `DestroyEffect`'s ``max_mana_value`` is a printed cap, while this is an
    exact match on a value known only at activation. Threaded through the
    same ``"x"`` sentinel `RulesEngine._substitute_x` rewrites for every
    other X-scaled magnitude — including the ``{X}{X}`` cost, which the mana
    model already doubles correctly.
