    """Elves you control have "Whenever this creature becomes tapped during
    your turn, untap it and put a +1/+1 counter on it. This ability
    triggers only once each turn."

    — Dionus, Elvish Archdruid. A layer-6 ability-adding grant (RULE
    613.7f) of a full triggered ability, not just a keyword or a mana
    ability (see `_tyvar_kell` above for the same distinction from layer
    3/RULE 612). Each Elf gets its *own* granted `TriggeredAbility`
    instance, scoped to itself (`continuous._granted_trigger_condition`) and
    cached across recomputes (`GameState._granted_ability_cache`) so its
    "once each turn" state survives — and stops being granted the instant
    the Elf (or Dionus) leaves, with no separate removal code. The nested
    "untap it"/"put a +1/+1 counter on it" effects use the self-acting
    (``target_kind: None``) mode of `tap`/`add_counters` — "it" is always
    the specific Elf the ability was granted to, never a player choice."""
