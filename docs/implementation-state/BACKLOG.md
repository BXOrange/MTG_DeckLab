# Backlog — open work, as tickets

**The single list of open work, backend and frontend.** Replaces the former
per-half `ToDo_Backend.md` / `ToDo_Frontend.md`, which no longer exist.

Three kinds of document, kept strictly apart — put a new line in the right
one:

| Kind | Lives in | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Open points** | this file | Only open scope. No history. |
| **Worklogs** | [Done_Backend.md](Done_Backend.md), [Done_Frontend.md](Done_Frontend.md) | Append-only. What shipped and *why it was built that way*. |
| **Examples** | [PARSER_LONG_TAIL.md](PARSER_LONG_TAIL.md) | Calibration samples + strategy for the indefinite parser tail. |

**Closing a ticket = deleting it from this file** and appending its narrative
to the matching `Done_*.md` section. Never leave a `[x]`, a "shipped" note,
or a "moved to Done" pointer here — this file is read in full, often, so
anything finished that stays costs every future read. If only part of a
ticket is done, keep only the part that isn't.

Ticket ids are stable; reuse a retired id only for the same subject.
Plan-level sequencing lives in
[10_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md](10_COMPLETION_ROADMAP.md).

| Prefix | Category |
| --- | --- |
| `ENG` | Game engine — turn/stack/priority loop, layers, targeting, combat plumbing |
| `PAR` | Parser — oracle-text → `AbilitySpec` recognition (`parser/oracle/`) |
| `MEC` | Game mechanics — a named MTG mechanic with no engine primitive yet |
| `PLR` | Player management — seats, multiplayer, bots, accounts, sessions |
| `VIS` | Visuals — frontend UI/UX |
| `DB` | Database — card cache, saved decks, persistence, data freshness |
| `ANA` | Deck analysis — UC2 (LLM + presentation) |

## PAR — Parser

- **PAR-12 · The indefinite long tail.** Strategy, current coverage, and
  worked examples: [PARSER_LONG_TAIL.md](PARSER_LONG_TAIL.md). Not a ticket
  that can be "closed" — a standing program. Planechase (901)/Archenemy
  (904) plane/scheme card *bodies* live here too (13/309 measured
  2026-08-04) — their trigger conditions are recognized, but the bodies are
  exotic even by tail standards, so this is ordinary long-tail work with a
  known card list, not a distinct gap. (Reaching a Planechase/Archenemy/
  Vanguard table at all is wired up end to end — Setup's format picker,
  `services/lobby.py`, `api/multiplayer.py`/`api/game.py` — see
  Done_Backend.md "PLR-13". Vanguard's own remaining piece — a per-seat
  avatar picker, and its avatars' card text — is a permanent non-goal, not
  a queued gap; see the MEC callout below.)

## MEC — Game mechanics

> **Permanent non-goals** (never to be built, not gaps): Stickers (RULE
> 123) and Attractions (RULE 717) — `gate.parse_oracle` classifies mentions
> of the former `NEVER_SUPPORTED`, a verdict kept out of both the coverage
> count and the backlog ranking. **Vanguard (RULE 902) beyond its already-
> shipped hand-size/life-total modifiers** — its ~107 avatars are a small,
> long-retired supplemental-product pool (not a real deck, no set is
> designed around it today), so neither a per-seat avatar picker (every
> seat just gets a random avatar — the modifiers apply regardless of which
> one) nor parser handlers for individual avatars' extra rules text will be
> built. Structurally enforced already, not just documented:
> `scripts/import_bulk.py`'s `_SKIP_LAYOUTS` drops the Scryfall `vanguard`
> layout from `cache/db/cards.db` entirely (0 of the 34,208 cached cards),
> so avatar text can never surface in `coverage_report.py`/
> `processing_list.py`'s ranking in the first place — the committed
> `services/variant_card_database.py` pool they live in instead is never
> read by either. `game/effect_binder.bind_from_catalogue` still binds
> whatever a general-purpose handler happens to already recognize when an
> avatar is actually boarded (RULE 902.2), same as any other unregistered
> card — that's ordinary runtime behavior, not scheduled work, and needs no
> special-casing to stay that way.

## PLR — Player management

- **PLR-4 · Names are the identity, unauthenticated.** Two people picking
  the same name share a seat; the second to connect takes over. Fine for a
  LAN table, not for anything public — needs [PLR-9].
- **PLR-7 · A bot that weighs lines.** `GreedyBot`'s `rank_targets`/`play`
  are the intended override points — the base class was split for exactly
  this — but nothing subclasses them; bots take the first legal offer.
- **PLR-8 · Bots at tables of 3+.** Now reachable, since the lobby opens
  tables of up to four: `Bot.rank_targets` takes options as offered and
  `GreedyBot._attack` swings at the first *player* defender in the list, so
  a bot in a pod hits whoever happens to be listed first every turn rather
  than choosing an opponent. Legal, and a bot pod plays out — it just isn't
  a decision. Shares its fix with [PLR-7]: `rank_targets` is the override
  point in both cases.
- **PLR-9 · User accounts.** Login/signup (docs/04 PART 4), auth token
  storage + attachment to API/WebSocket calls, browser-refresh reconnect
  flow (docs/04 S1), and login/signup pages. Saved decks are unscoped until
  this exists — anyone hitting the API sees every deck.
- **PLR-14 · Team variants (RULE 809/810/811).** Two-Headed Giant, Emperor
  and Grand Melee are the part of CR 8 that `models/game_format.py`
  deliberately doesn't model: unlike the RULE 9 variants (which add a card
  pool beside the game) these change the **turn structure itself** — a
  shared life total, two players taking one turn together, a "defending
  team" in combat, RULE 810.8's shared damage assignment. That's a turn-loop
  and combat project, not a format record. The seats it needs exist now (a
  table opens for up to four), so what's left is genuinely the turn loop;
  reaching it from the UI follows the same already-shipped format-picker
  pattern the RULE 9 variants use (Done_Backend.md "PLR-13").

## VIS — Visuals

- **VIS-1 · Error/loading states** for network calls (spinner, retry,
  offline message). docs/04 C4.
- **VIS-4 · Chat / emotes at the table.**
- **VIS-8 · Keyboard shortcuts.** docs/05 PART 9.
- **VIS-9 · Accessibility** — alt-text on cards, tab navigation,
  high-contrast mode. docs/05 PART 10.
- **VIS-10 · Responsive/mobile layout** — only checked at desktop width.

> No Node/npm on this machine, so there is no JS linter/formatter/typecheck
> — but real-browser verification *is* available: Playwright (Python) lives
> in `backend/venv` and drives a real Chromium against the static frontend
> server plus a running backend. Use it for any non-trivial UI change
> instead of reading code and replaying API calls by hand.

## DB — Database

- **DB-1 · Stale cached rows keep lossy mana-cost data.** A pre-
  `mana_cost_string` row is priced from the legacy pip tally +
  `converted_mana_cost` via `ManaCost.from_card` — correct total/colors, but
  hybrid/Phyrexian nuance is unavailable until the self-healing refetch
  (`Card.has_mana_cost_data`) happens to hit it. `models/mana_cost.py`,
  `services/lazy_card_loader.py`.
- **DB-2 · The commander ban list is hand-maintained.** Scryfall's
  per-printing `legalities` isn't fetched, so there's no live source.
  Deliberately conservative (only long-standing entries that survived unban
  waves); needs manual updates against the official page.
  `services/commander_legality.py`'s `BANNED_COMMANDER_CARDS`.
- **DB-3 · Commander legality gaps.** No Background / "Friends forever"
  pairing, and no check that a commander is actually legendary.
  `check_commander_legality` covers color identity, the ban list, and plain
  Partner/"Partner with X" only.

> **Gotcha:** adding a field to `Card` changes the schema hash, and
> `CardDatabase` wipes the whole app cache on mismatch. Recover offline with
> `python scripts/import_bulk.py --reseed-only` (rebuilds ~34k rows from
> `RawCardStore`). A targeted per-field backfill is never the right answer —
> the wipe is all-or-nothing.

## ANA — Deck analysis

- **ANA-1 · `POST /api/decks/{id}/analyze`.** Claude API integration, prompt
  templates, structured output parsing, caching (docs/02 UC2, docs/04 Phase
  6). `Deck.analysis_id` is reserved to link a saved deck to the result, but
  no `Analysis` model/table exists — design it alongside the endpoint rather
  than assuming the reserved field's shape is final.
- **ANA-2 · Narrative analysis UI** — win conditions, archetype, synergies,
  cohesion score, issues. Sits alongside the existing static/Bracket
  sub-tabs, not replacing them. Blocked on [ANA-1].
- **ANA-3 · Cache indicator** ("Analysis from X ago") for that LLM result.
  Blocked on [ANA-1].
